At a broad level, upgrading a Porter-provisioned EKS cluster involves the following main steps:

1. Upgrading the EKS control plane
2. Updating the launch configuration for the cluster's autoscale groups to use a new EKS AMI
3. Refreshing the instances in the cluster to use the new AMI

:::warning Application Downtime
Please note - this process may incur downtime for a couple of minutes at the end, as yoru cluster's nodes are switched out for newer nodes - at this stage, Kubernetes will be responsible for switching your applications to working nodes, which may render them inaccessible for a few minutes.

## Upgrading the EKS control plane

To upgrade the cluster's control plane, navigate to the EKS dashboard on your AWS account, and for the cluster in question, click on `Update now`, in the `Kubernetes version` column.

This process may take 20-30 minutes; you can check whether the upgrade's finished by hitting the Refresh button above your cluster list. Once the cluster's version is successfully upgraded, you can proceed to the next step.
