title: Deleting Dangling Resources

When you delete your project or clusters, Porter automatically destroys your resources so you don't get charged for any unused resources. Sometimes, this automatic destruction occurs only partially and results in dangling resources. This is a guide with specific steps on how to delete these resources for each cloud provider.

## AWS

Please note that the instructions in the following sections need to be used in the order they're specified in; not following the sequence will result in errors whilst trying to delete resources that may be dependent on other resources within your account.

### Deleting EKS

Go to the **EKS** section on your AWS console, and delete the cluster in question, if it's visible.

### Removing Auto Scaling Groups & Launch Configurations

On the **EC2** dashboard, navigate to the **Auto Scaling Groups** section, and remove any auto scaling groups that contain your cluster's name. Once they're deleted, you need to delete any launch configurations that may be left over, containing your cluster's name.

### Removing Load Balancers

First, navigate to the **VPC** section in your AWS console to see the VPC's that are currently in use. Select the VPC that belongs to the cluster you've provisioned, and copy the VPC ID. Then go to the **Load Balancers** section on the **EC2** dashboard, and locate the load balancer for your cluster using the VPC ID you just copied as a filter - delete any load balancers found.

### Terminating EC2 nodes

Deleting the EKS cluster and associated auto scaling groups and launch configurations will ensure your EC2 nodes are also terminated; you can navigate to the **Instances** section on the EC2 dashboard to confirm.

### Removing VPC Resources

Navigate to the **VPC** section in your AWS console to see the VPC's that are currently in use. Select the VPC that belongs to the cluster you've provisioned, and copy the VPC ID.

1. Click on **NAT Gateways**, and use the VPC ID to filter out the NAT Gateway for your cluster; select it and then click on **Actions** -> **Delete NAT Gateway**. 
2. After ensuring the NAT Gateway was deleted, navigate to **Internet Gateways**, and use the VPC ID to locate the Internet Gateway for your cluster; select it and click on **Actions** -> **Detach from VPC**. Once the gateway is detached, select **Actions** -> **Delete Internet gateway**.
3.

AWS might warn you that the VPC cannot be deleted due to existing NAT gateways or network interfaces that are in use. Click on the text **NAT Gateways** to view the NAT gateway in use. Once you delete the NAT gateway, you'll be able to delete the VPC.

### Deleting Elastic IP

Head to the **Elastic IP addresses** section in the VPC tab. Select the EIP of the cluster you have deleted and click **Actions > Release Elastic IP Addresses**.

## Deleting EKS

Head to the **EKS** tab, select the cluster and click **Delete** .

### Deleting Nodes

It sometimes occurs that even after the EKS cluster has been deleted, the actual **EC2 machines** comprising the cluster do not get deleted properly. Navigate to **EC2 > Autoscaling Groups** and ensure that autoscaling groups attached to your cluster has been deleted. **If this autoscaling group persists, AWS will continue to spin back up your nodes even after manual deletion.**

Once you've deleted the **Autoscaling Group**, head to **EC2 > Instances** and delete all the nodes.
