## Deploying Porter via Helm

It is possible to deploy Porter on an existing Kubernetes cluster using Helm. For a basic installation, run the following:

```sh
helm repo add porter https://charts-self-hosted.porter.run
helm install porter porter/porter
```

By default, the Porter instance is configured to connect to the same cluster instance it is installed on. To get started, run the following:

```sh
kubectl port-forward pod/<porter-pod> 8080:8080
```

Then, navigate to the Porter dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` and log in. If you are the first user created on the Porter instance, you will be automatically added to the `default` project, which is connected to the cluster. After logging in, you will have access to the dashboard, which will look something like this:
