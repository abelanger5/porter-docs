In order to offer Github login, you will need to set up an OAuth application in Github that will authorize reading Github user data. To offer reading from/writing to Github repositories, you need to create a Github App in Github. In this guide, we assume you are setting up a Github integration for a Porter instance running on `porter.example.com`. Let's get started!

## Setting Up Github Login

### Step 1: Github OAuth Application Creation

:::info

**Note:** you can view the most up-to-date instructions for creating a Github OAuth app in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

:::

Navigate to your organization settings page (alternately, you can navigate to your personal settings page) and select **Developer Settings** in the sidebar. Go to **OAuth Apps** and select **New OAuth App**. You can fill it in with the following fields:

- **Application name:** Porter
- **Homepage URL:** https://getporter.dev
- **Authorization callback URL:** `https://<your-domain>/api/oauth/github/callback`

The registration form should look something like this:

After creating the OAuth application, select "Generate a new client secret" and store the secret value somewhere. You will need this for the next step.

### Step 2: Update Porter Environment Variables

Add the following Github credentials to your Porter instance:

```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-github-client-id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-github-client-secret>
```

:::info

**Note:** if you ever want to enable Github login, you can set the environment variable `GITHUB_LOGIN_ENABLED=false`.

:::

Restart the Porter instance, and you will be given the option to log in with Github!

## Setting Up Github Repository Integrations

### Step 1: Github App Creation

Navigate to your organization settings page (alternately, you can navigate to your personal settings page) and select **Developer Settings** in the sidebar. Go to **Github Apps** and select **New Github App**. You should use the following settings:

- Callback URL: `<protocol>://<your-domain>/api/oauth/github-app/callback`
- The **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** checkbox should be checked.
- Webhook URL: `<protocol>://<your-domain>/api/integrations/github-app/webhook`
- Webhook secret: generate a random webhook secret for your domain, for example by running `cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 32`.
- Permissions:
  - Repository Permissions:
    - `Actions`: `Read and Write`
    - Contents: Read and Write
    - Metadata: Read-Only
    - Secrets: Read and Write
    - Workflows: Read and Write
  - Organization Permissions:
    - Members: Read-Only
  - User Permissions:
    - Email Addresses: Read-Only

### Step 2: Downloading a Private Key

After creating the Github App, generate a new private key for your app. Put this private key either somewhere in your filesystem, or mount it into the container if using Kubernetes or Swarm to deploy.

### Step 3: Update Porter Environment Variables

Add the following Github credentials to your Porter instance:

```sh
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=<github-app-id>
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<github-secret>
GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook-secret>
GITHUB_APP_NAME=<github-app-name>
GITHUB_APP_ID=<github-app-id>
GITHUB_APP_SECRET_PATH=<path-to-secret>
```
