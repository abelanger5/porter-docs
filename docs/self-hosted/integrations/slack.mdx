## Enabling Slack Integrations

For order to set up a Slack integration on a self-hosted version of Porter, you must create a new Slack app in your workspace for sending Porter notifications.

### Step 1: Create Application and Environment Variables

Navigate to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), and click **Create New App**. On the modal that pops up, select **From Scratch** and then enter your app name and workspace you want to develop in. On the page for the application, scroll down to **App Credentials** and take note of the following two values:

<img
  width="689"
  alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-09 at 10 25 41 AM"
  src="https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/502dd6ad-adff-456f-2d72-e7211a5eb600/large"
/>

Copy these values into the following environment variables in your installation:

```
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=<client-id-above>
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret-above>
```

### Step 2: Setting up OAuth

The app also needs to be able to perform the OAuth flow with the right callback link. To do this,
navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in the Slack developer settings and add the url `https://yourdomain.com/api/oauth/slack/callback` to the list of redirect URLs:

That's it! You can now follow [this guide](https://docs.porter.run/docs/setting-up-slack-notifications) for setting up Slack notifications in Porter.
