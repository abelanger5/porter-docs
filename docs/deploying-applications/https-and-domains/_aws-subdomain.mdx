Create a `CNAME` record on your DNS provider for your desired subdomain, which points to the load balancer URL you have copied above. Make sure you exclude the protocol `http://` and any trailing `/` from the URL string. For example, on Route 53, this looks like the following:

![CNAME record](https://files.readme.io/88b8b8a-Screen_Shot_2021-01-18_at_6.53.16_PM.png "CNAME record")
