Create a `CNAME` record on your DNS provider for your desired subdomain, which points to the load balancer URL you have copied above. Make sure you exclude the protocol `http://` and any trailing `/` from the URL string. For example, on Route 53, this looks like the following:

![CNAME record](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/be14bc42-4f63-4d3b-d0eb-5d4d71438700/large "CNAME record")
