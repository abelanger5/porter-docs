In order to connect to an existing GCR instance, you must create a service account with permission to push/pull from GCR.

1. First, go to your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and navigate to **IAM & Admin** -> **Service Accounts**:

2. Select **Create Service Account**:

3. Name your service account (for example, "porter-gcr-access"), grant the service account **Storage Admin** permissions, then select **Done**:

4. After creating the service account, you will be redirected to the list of service accounts. Find the row with the newly created service account, and select "Manage keys" in the "Actions" column:

5. Finally, press the "Add key" dropdown and select "Create new key". After choosing the **JSON** key type, your key file will be **automatically** downloaded:

Now that you have downloaded this key, run the following command on the Porter CLI:

```sh
porter connect gcr
```

You will be prompted for the full path to the service account key file that you just downloaded. **Enter the full path (not relative) to the key file location**:

```sh
Key file location: [PATH]
```

Finally, you will be prompted to provide the registry URL, in the form `[GCR_DOMAIN]/[GCP_PROJECT_ID]`, and a name for the registry. For most, the GCR domain will be `gcr.io` (for more information, [click here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/overview#registries)).

```sh
Please provide the registry URL, in the form [GCP_DOMAIN]/[GCP_PROJECT_ID]. For example, gcr.io/my-project-123456.
Registry URL:
Give this registry a name:
```

That's it! If you navigate to the "Launch" tab in the dashboard, you should see your existing GCR images in the "Registry" section.
