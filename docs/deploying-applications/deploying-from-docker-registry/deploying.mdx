## Deploying your Docker Image

:::info Prerequisites

If you would like to deploy from a private Docker registry, make sure that you've following the guide for [linking an existing registry](./linking-existing-registry).

:::

To deploy your application, first navigate to the **Launch** tab, where you will see three types of applications to deploy: web, worker, or job. To understand the difference between these three application types, see the description of the [types of applications](../overview#types-of-applications). After selecting your application type and selecting **Launch Template**, you should select the **Docker Registry** option:

INSERT IMAGE

Next, you can either select a public or private Docker image to deploy from:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

import DeployPublicSection from "./_deploy-public-section.mdx";
import DeployPrivateSection from "./_deploy-private-section.mdx";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="private" label="Private" default>
    <DeployPrivateSection />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="public" label="Public">
    <DeployPublicSection />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Under **Additional Settings**, you can configure remaining options like your service's port and computing resources. Once you're ready, click the **Deploy** button to launch. You will be redirected to the cluster dashboard where you should see your newly deployed service.

## Updating your Docker Image

### Manual Updates

To update the Docker image which your application is running, open the application on the Porter dashboard. If your Docker image has a unique image tag, you can navigate to the **Settings** tab and select a new tag for your image:

If your Docker image tag is `latest` (or you re-use the same image tag for different images), there are different options depending on if you are running an web/worker or a job:

- If running a **web or worker** application, navigate to the **Main** tab and hit "Deploy" with no configuration changes. This will re-pull the image by default. (TODO IMAGE AND TAB)
- If running a **job** application, set the configuration option in the Advanced section! (TODO IMAGE AND TAB)

### Programmatic Updates

To programmatically redeploy your service (for instance, from a CI pipeline), you will need to call your service's custom webhook. You can find your webhook by expanding your deployed service and going to the **Settings** tab.

Make sure to replace the `YOUR_COMMIT_HASH` field with the tag of your Docker image.
