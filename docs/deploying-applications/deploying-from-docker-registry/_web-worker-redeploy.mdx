If running a **web or worker** application, navigate to the **Main** tab and hit "Deploy" with no configuration changes:

![Web/Worker Redeploy](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/367a5fa1-4ba6-4804-546c-dc6718f71b00/large "Web/Worker Redeployment")

This will re-pull the image by default.
