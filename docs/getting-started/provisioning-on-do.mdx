title: Provisioning on Digital Ocean
---

Porter runs on a Kubernetes cluster in your own Digital Ocean account. Digital Ocean is by far the easiest cloud provider to get set up on. You can provision a cluster through Porter by choosing Digital Ocean on Porter, then simply logging into your Digital Ocean account.

## Provisioning Resources on Digital Ocean

After you select Digital Ocean, you'll see the screen below. Select which resources you'd want to provision in your account. Once you click **Submit**, you'll be redirected to Digital Ocean's login page.

After you log in, you'll see a message that says resources are being provisioned. This will take on average 15 minutes. Once the resources have been provisioned, refresh the page and you'll see a cluster connected to Porter.
