title: Provisioning Infrastructure
description: Install resources in the cloud provider of your choice via Porter.
---

Porter provisions and manages the underlying infrastructure in your own cloud. During project creation, Porter will prompt you to provision resources in one of the three cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Digital Ocean.

For step by step instructions on how to provision infrastructure in each cloud provider, see the links below.

- [Provisioning on AWS](doc:getting-started-on-aws)
- [Provisioning on Google Cloud](doc:provisioning-on-google-cloud)
- [Provisioning on Digital Ocean](doc:provisioning-on-digital-ocean)

As mentioned in the [previous section](https://docs.porter.run/docs/linking-up-application-source), Porter provisions a Kubernetes cluster and an image registry in your cloud provider. It is not necessary to know much about the provisioned resources to use Porter, other than a few basic concepts. For those looking for a brief introduction to Kubernetes, we cover these basic concepts in [Kubernetes 101](doc:kubernetes-101).

Across all cloud providers, infrastructure that's provisioned by Porter has the same architecture. For those who are curious, you can find the diagram of Porter's cluster architecture [here](doc:kubernetes-101).

# FAQ

## Which instance type should I select?

The instance type you select depends on how much resources each of your application requires. Each of your application cannot exceed the amount of resources available on a single instance. For example, if you want to run an application with 4GB memory on AWS, the instance type you select should be larger than the `t2.medium` instances because they only have 2 vCPU and 4GB memory.

You can [read more about how resource allocation works on Kubernetes here](doc:kubernetes-101). If you are unsure which instance type you should select, [book a free consultation call with our solution architects](mailto:contact@porter.run).

## How much does the underlying infrastructure cost?

The cost of your infrastructure varies entirely on the amount of resources you use. By default, clusters provisioned by Porter cost around 200$ on AWS and GCP, and around $100 on Digital Ocean.
