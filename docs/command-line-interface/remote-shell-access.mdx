title: Remote Shell Access to an Existing Application

:::info Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [`porter auth login`](./porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [`porter projects list`](./porter-project), and set the project via [`porter config set-project [PROJECT_ID]`](./porter-config)
- You're connected to the correct cluster by running [`porter clusters list`](./porter-cluster), and set the cluster via [`porter config set-cluster [PROJECT_ID]`](./porter-config)

:::

The `porter run` command allows users to execute a command on a remote container:

```
porter run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard (this can be a release either in the "Applications" or the "Jobs" tab).

## Examples

If you have a release called `web`, and you would like to enter an interactive shell in the container attached to `web`:

```sh
porter run web -- sh
```

To test that remote execution is working, you can run:

```sh
porter run web -- echo "hello world"
```

To run in a namespace other than `default`, use the `--namespace` flag:

```sh
porter run web --namespace other-namespace -- sh
```
