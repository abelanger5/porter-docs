:::info Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [`porter auth login`](./command-reference/porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [`porter projects list`](./command-reference/porter-project), and set the project via [`porter config set-project [PROJECT_ID]`](./command-reference/porter-config)
- You're connected to the correct cluster by running [`porter clusters list`](./command-reference/porter-cluster), and set the cluster via [`porter config set-cluster [PROJECT_ID]`](./command-reference/porter-config)

The `porter run` command allows users to execute a command on a remote container:

```
porter run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard (this can be a release either in the "Applications" or the "Jobs" tab).

It can also cleanup residual copies (called **ephemeral pods**) of applications that may have been left behind as a result of a previous call to `porter run`:

```
porter run cleanup
```

You may learn more about ephemeral pods in the [Ephemeral Pods](#ephemeral-pods) section.

## Examples

If you have a release called `web`, and you would like to enter an interactive shell in the container attached to `web`:

```sh
porter run web -- sh
```

To test that remote execution is working, you can run:

```sh
porter run web -- echo "hello world"
```

To run in a namespace other than `default`, use the `--namespace` flag:

```sh
porter run web --namespace other-namespace -- sh
```

Running the above commands will spin up a copy of the release and in some cases, these copies might be left behind. This may not be ideal and hence, running the following command will help you clean them up:

```sh
porter run cleanup
```

To cleanup such copies of releases in other namespaces, use the `--namespace` flag:

```sh
porter run cleanup --namespace other-namespace
```

## Ephemeral Pods

When you call `porter run` for remote shell access into an application, it creates an exact copy of it. These are called **ephemeral pods**. In some cases, these ephemeral pods might not get deleted once they are exited from.

In order to save resources, Porter deploys a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) that runs every hour in the background to scan for and delete any leftover ephemeral pods.
To accommodate for scenarios where you might need access to such an ephemeral pod for longer than usual, the cron job only deletes those ephemeral pods which are more than 6 hours old.

The `porter run cleanup` command comes in handy for when you want to delete any leftover ephemeral pods manually.
