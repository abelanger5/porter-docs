## Customizing Network Settings for an Application

Most of the time, you can customize the NGINX configuration by adding an "Ingress Annotation" when deploying a web service. This can be found in the "Advanced" tab of the web template:

To add an annotation, simply click "Add row" and add key-value pairs for the annotation.

### Setting Custom Read/Write Timeouts

Read/write timeouts are very application-specific, and are subject to change on the Porter templates. For example, if you have a websocket application that does not handle dropped connections gracefully, you may be inclined to set your read/write timeout to be much higher than what is standard (~30 seconds). For those coming from Heroku, the Heroku router enforces a write timeout of 30 seconds, and will keep a connection alive if a single byte is sent within a 55 second window.

On Porter, you can configure your own read/write timeouts by adding annotations:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout: "60s"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "60s"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "60s"
```

For an explanation of these values:

| Annotation                                          | Description                                                            |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout` | The timeout for NGINX to establish a connection with your application. |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout`    | The timeout for NGINX to transmit a request to your application.       |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout`    | The timeout for NGINX to read a response from your application.        |

It is thus recommended to set these values with the ordering `proxy-connect-timeout <= proxy-send-timeout <= proxy-read-timeout`.

### Client Max Body Size

If you are getting undesired `413 Request Entity Too Large` errors, you can increase the maximum size of the client request by setting the field [client_max_body_size](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size). You can do this by adding the following annotation:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m
```

This will set the maximum client request body size to 8 megabytes.
